# Unlocking-Enzyme-Discovery

An integrated machine learning and bioinformatics pipeline for discovering scarce, high-value enzymes from vast, under-annotated genomic repositories.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
High-throughput sequencing has generated massive genomic datasets, yet the lack of precise annotation severely hampers enzyme discovery.  
This project presents a **robust, generalizable framework** that integrates phylogenetic analysis, protein language models, and multi-level contact scoring to identify and prioritize functional enzyme variants at scale.

## ðŸ”¬ Key Features
1. **High-resolution, cross-kingdom phylogenetic database**  
   - Covers bacterial, fungal, plant, and metagenomic sequences  
   - Avoids redundancy while maximizing evolutionary diversity  

2. **Multi-locus phylogenetic mining**  
   - Detects candidate enzymes via conserved multi-locus signatures  

3. **Evolutionary-scale protein language model prediction**  
   - Predicts enzyme activities directly from protein sequences  

4. **Multi-level residueâ€“atom contact rescoring**  
   - Eliminates false positives from docking and enriches high-value hits
